### Latency & IOPS Overview

| Tier | Access Latency | IOPS Characteristics | Notes |
|-----|----|----|----|
| Hot | Lowest (milliseconds) | High and consistent | Ideal for frequent reads/writes | 
| Cool | Slightly higher (still milliseconds) | Comparable to Hot | Best for infrequent access, backups | 
| Cold | Millisecond-level | Similar to Hot/Cool | Optimized for rarely accessed data | 
| Archive | Hours (rehydration required) | Not applicable until rehydrated | Offline tier; not suitable for active workloads | 

ðŸ§  Key Insights
- Hot, Cool, and Cold tiers all offer millisecond-level latency and similar throughput and IOPS, making them suitable for online access.
- The main differences lie in availability SLAs, early deletion penalties, and costsâ€”not raw performance.
- Archive tier is a different beast: itâ€™s offline and requires rehydration (up to 15 hours) before access, so itâ€™s not part of the IOPS conversation.
Microsoft doesnâ€™t publish exact IOPS numbers for each tier because performance is influenced by factors like blob size, concurrency, and region. But for most workloads, Hot, Cool, and Cold tiers behave similarly in terms of responsiveness.

### Using Managed Identities in On-Premises Environments

#### Azure Arcâ€“enabled servers

Applications or processes running on Azure Arc-enabled servers can use system-assigned managed identities to obtain tokens for any Entra-protected resource. To set this up, install the Azure Connected Machine agent on your non-Azure server; behind the scenes it exposes a local identity endpoint that your code can call for tokens.

Documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/managed-identity-authentication

#### Azure Automation Hybrid Workers
You can run runbooks on on-prem machines under the authentication context of a Managed Identity. Configure a Hybrid Worker Group in your Automation Account, enable the accountâ€™s managed identity, install the Hybrid Worker agent on your on-prem VM, then target that group when you start the runbook. This lets your on-prem script call Azure services (Key Vault, Storage, etc.) without storing credentials.

#### Microsoft Entra cloud-governed management for on-premises workloads

Learn how to extend Entra IDâ€™s identity governance and secure remote access to AD-integrated and federation-based applications running on-prem. Topics include Application Proxy, lifecycle management for on-prem AD accounts, B2B collaboration, and unified governance for both cloud and on-prem apps.

Documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/cloud-governed-management-for-on-premises

### Managed Identities Across Entra Tenants (Multi-Tenant Scenarios)

#### Federated Identity Credentials for Entra Apps (GA)

You can now configure a user-assigned managed identity as a federated credential on an Entra App registration. This establishes trust so that workloads running under that managed identityâ€”across tenantsâ€”can request tokens for your multi-tenant app without secrets or certificates.

#### Securing managed identities in Microsoft Entra ID

Deep dive into system-assigned vs. user-assigned identities, how token acquisition and RBAC work for both control- and data-plane operations, and best practices for least-privilege and auditing.
